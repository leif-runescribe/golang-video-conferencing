## Tech 
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Two mplementations of the Server in Golang (Gin and MUX )

## Key Features
- Peer-to-peer video calls
- Dynamic room creation
- Audio/video toggle controls
- WebRTC-based direct media streaming

1. **Signaling**: Gin WebSocket server handles peer connection negotiations
2. **Peer Connection**: 
   - Exchanges session descriptions
   - Manages ICE candidates
   - Establishes direct peer connections
3. **Media Streaming**: WebRTC enables direct browser-to-browser media transmission

## Highlights

- Low-latency video/audio streaming
- Secure, encrypted peer connections
- Adaptive to different network conditions

## Running the Project
```bash
# Start Golang backend
